    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sushi bake is a casserole-style dish that uses the similar ingredients to sushi. A sushi bake typically consists of layers of seasoned sushi
        rice, a creamy seafood mixture, and a variety of toppings. It pairs well with nori (dried seaweed) or just to eat by itself.
